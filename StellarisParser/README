# StellarisParser

This tool is meant to be a very quick and dirty parser for Stellaris' data format. In order to demonstrate a purpose for this, I've created a small program which, given as input Stellaris's main folder, will parse all .txt files and merge down entries to list out all possible entries in each data type and output a text file with this content inside. I hope this will help modders figure out just what commands are currently available.

# Bugs and such

There are probably still bugs in this. I've noticed that the parsing for the flags definition file is a bit broken due to the weird layout used, but it's not too serious.

I welcome bug reports and pull requests, but I cannot guarantee whether this will be maintained. I encourage people to fork this and use the basic parser in their future projects.
